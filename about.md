# About Me

My name is Dan. Sometimes I go by Agr0, sometimes Agr0Dan. I live in the USA. I hack things for fun. I work in Infosec. I also like sushi and video games, and have been known to dabble in board games from time to time. Y'know, when there isn't a global pandemic in the way.

They say that if you enjoy what you do, then you won't work a day in your life. I love information security, so I guess that worked out pretty well huh?
